You can use **Hardhat Network**, a built-in local Ethereum network that behaves just like a real one. It's like spinning up your own nodeâ€”but it's *instant, in-memory, and made for development*.

### ðŸ§ª What You Get with Hardhat Network

- **A local blockchain** that runs in-process with your Hardhat environment
- Pre-funded accounts for testing
- Support for *console logs*, stack traces, gas tracking, etc.
- Smart contracts deploy and run just like on Sepolia or mainnet
- No RPC keys, no node syncing, no latency

### ðŸ”„ Typical Workflow

1. **Start the local Hardhat node**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat node
   ```

   This will launch a local JSON-RPC server at `http://127.0.0.1:8545`.

2. **Deploy your contracts to it**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

3. **Hook your React app to it** using Ethers:

   ```js
   const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('http://127.0.0.1:8545');
   ```

   Bonus: you can use one of the pre-funded private keys from the Hardhat node for signing transactions in development.

This setup is amazing for local-first development and quick iteration.
