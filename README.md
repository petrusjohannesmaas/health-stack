# Health Stack OS

- **Core mission**: Decentralized healthcare infrastructure that brings *transparency, accountability, and sustainability*.
- **Initial use case**: A system that builds trust with philanthropic stakeholders through efficient fund distribution.
- **Current challenge**: The infrastructure setup is slowing progress on smart contract development.
- **Ideal next move**: Strip things down, shift toward a simpler dev loop, and start testing your smart contracts in a local simulation.


### ðŸ§± Dev Stack for Smart Contract Focus

To accelerate the prototype without drowning in infrastructure complexity:

| Layer              | Tool Suggestion                    | Why                                |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Smart contracts    | Hardhat + Solidity                 | Easy local testnet, mocking, forking mainnet |
| Frontend/Dashboard| React (or Svelte) + Role-based logic | Quick integration for RBAC views   |
| Off-chain data     | SQLite or Postgres via Prisma      | Simple and flexible for prototyping |
| Blockchain layer   | Hardhat local node or Anvil        | Simulates EVM without Besu headaches |
| Staking logic      | Simulated via mock tokens          | Emulate funds and distributions without DeFi setup |
| File storage       | Skip IPFS for now                  | Focus on core contract logic and workflows |

### ðŸŽ¯ Suggested First Milestone
> âœ… _Develop a local dApp using Hardhat that simulates the clinic flow, connects hospital "wallets" to role-based interfaces, and includes stake-funded bonus logic as a prototype._

This lets you:
- Validate your smart contracts
- Simulate incentive logic
- Build something you can *show*

From there, we can layer in Decentralized Storage, Validator Nodes, or even Cardano later if they serve the architectureâ€”not block it.
