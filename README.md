# üõ£Ô∏è Health Stack Roadmap

### Theoretical starting point:
- üè• No existing hospital systems (paper or digital)
- üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è No established staff‚Äînurses, admins, or clinicians will be onboarded
- üß∞ No physical infrastructure yet defined beyond a facility shell (or basic layout)
- ‚öôÔ∏è Our software must guide, train, and enforce best practices from day one

So instead of just software, I'm building a **hospital-in-a-box** platform that boots up a fully functional health facility‚Äîdigitally and operationally.

---

### **Phase 0: Operating Philosophy & Service Blueprint**
Define what kind of facility we‚Äôre even creating:
- [1. Philosophy & Principles](/docs/philosophy_and_principles.md)
- [2. Core Health Stack OS Modules](/docs/core_modules.md)
- [3. Patient States & Intake Flow](/docs/patient_states_and_intake_flow.md)
- [4. Roles & Access](/docs/roles_and_access.md)

---

### **Phase 1: Digital Operating System Core**
Create the system that will guide and train people from day one:
- [5. Development Setup](/docs/development_setup.md)
- **Identity System**: Develop QR based identity system
- **Develop Dashboards**: Build core modules interfaces and implement access policies
- **Onboarding Content**: Walks staff through first login and explains role functions
- **Standard operating workflows**: Step-by-step task flows for common hospital scenarios (triage, vitals collection, medication administration, etc.)

---

### **Phase 2: Staff Lifecycle & Scheduling**
Establish people management before patients arrive:
- Staff registration (name, role, qualifications, shift availability)
- Role-based access and checklists (e.g. ‚Äúpharmacist on duty‚Äù unlocks medication dispensing)
- Basic shift planning tool

---

### **Phase 3: Patient Registration & Encounter Logging**
Enable patient-facing functionality:
- Patient intake interface (walk-ins or referred)
- Visit logs: clinical notes, triage results, vitals
- Smart nudges for incomplete data capture

---

### **Phase 4: Resource & Inventory Setup**
Before treatments begin, supplies must exist:
- Initial stock loading with barcode scanning
- Room/bed assignment system
- Daily usage logging with contextual feedback (e.g. low gloves for emergency care)

---

### **Phase 5: Real-Time Communication & Alerts**
Essential for high-stakes coordination:
- Broadcast alerts (e.g. code blue)
- Patient-linked task communication
- Emergency contact protocols (fire, security, ambulance coordination)

---

## üß≠ Strategic Outcome

By the end of this rollout, we‚Äôll have:
- A guided digital framework for new staff to onboard and deliver care effectively  
- The foundation for clinical audits, analytics, and expansion  
- A blueprint that could replicate this hospital model elsewhere‚Äîfranchise-style or NGO-deployable

Want to dive into a naming convention for this ‚Äúhospital OS‚Äù? Or should we start building out the schemas for staff, roles, and patient flows as a next step?
