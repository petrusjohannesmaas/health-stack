### ðŸŒ± Core Principles
- **Practicality** â€” solutions must work in real-world, resource-constrained settings  
- **Compassion** â€” every system exists to support human dignity and healing  
- **Modularity** â€” build components that evolve and scale independently  
- **Transparency** â€” ensure accountability across users, data, and fund flows  
- **Minimalism** â€” start with the smallest system that can demonstrate value  
- **Selective Decentralization** â€” use blockchain only where trustless automation is meaningful

### ðŸŽ¯ Who Are We Serving?

We are building for the **general inpatient**:  
A patient admitted for **overnight or longer** care that **cannot be managed in an outpatient setting**. These individuals form the **core population** of a general hospital wardâ€”neither ICU-critical nor receiving specialized care like maternity, oncology, or long-term chronic disease support.

We are also designing for:
- **Clinical and administrative staff** who navigate admissions, care, and discharges  
- **Donors and partners** seeking transparent impact for their funding  
- **Developers and operators** who deploy and iterate on decentralized health platforms

### ðŸ’¡ Typical Needs of General Inpatients
- **Ongoing monitoring** (e.g. vitals, IV medications, wound care)  
- **Diagnostic testing** (lab work, basic imaging)  
- **Short- to medium-term recovery** (e.g. infections, dehydration, post-op care)

---

### ðŸ“Œ Real-World Scenarios

- Pneumonia requiring IV antibiotics and oxygen  
- Post-surgical recovery following appendectomy  
- Diabetic foot ulcer needing wound care and glucose stabilization  
- Urinary tract infection with dehydration needing IV fluids and observation  

These are common, high-frequency use cases that benefit most from **streamlined digital workflows**.

### ðŸ§­ Why Focus on This Group?

By designing for general inpatients, we can:
- Build **universal workflows** that apply across clinics and geographies  
- Create a **repeatable care model** for scale-up and specialization later  
- Onboard new staff into **essential clinical protocols** using simple, guided interfaces  
- Lay the foundation for **incentive-linked funding** through smart contracts

---

### ðŸ”— The Off-Chain and Blockchain Balance

Health Stack OS starts with an **off-chain-first** designâ€”fast, flexible, and privacy-preservingâ€”but integrates a minimal blockchain layer to prove the value of verifiable, transparent funding.

This phase focuses on:
- Patient-state tracking and role-based workflows (off-chain)  
- A single staking vault smart contract to disburse funds when care milestones are reached (on-chain)

Future layersâ€”referral escrows, DAO governance, compliance scoringâ€”will build on this, only when needed.
