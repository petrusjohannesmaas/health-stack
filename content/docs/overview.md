## 🧭 Philosophy & Principles

Health Stack OS is built on the premise that **ethical care, transparent funding, and digital sovereignty** can co-exist. Rooted in the belief that communities deserve accountable systems, the platform prioritizes:

- **Transparency by Design** – enabling donors, staff, and patients to understand and trust every decision
- **Modular Architecture** – allowing for scalable adoption without sacrificing local adaptability
- **Simplicity First** – solving the right problems with the smallest, clearest steps
- **Off-chain First** – operational speed and patient safety come before decentralization
- **Selective Decentralization** – blockchain is used only where trustless execution creates tangible value

## 🧍‍♀️ Humans

At its core, Health Stack OS is about **people**. The system is designed around the realities and responsibilities of:

- **Patients** – whose care, dignity, and outcomes drive every design decision  
- **Frontline Staff** – clinicians, nurses, and coordinators who carry the weight of healthcare  
- **Administrators** – who facilitate access, manage resources, and ensure continuity  
- **Donors & Partners** – whose resources fuel mission-critical efforts and need traceable impact  
- **System Stewards** – developers and operators ensuring ethical, secure implementation  

Every module is designed to respect time, reduce friction, and reinforce **human accountability**—not replace it.

## 🔁 Intake to Discharge Flow

Health Stack OS models the full lifecycle of a patient visit as a structured state machine:

```plaintext
Intake → Registered → Triage → Admitted → Under Care → Ready for Discharge → Discharged
                                 ↓          ↓                   ↓                ↓
                            Referred   Escalated         Delayed Discharge    End
```

This flow supports:
- Clinician triage and escalation
- Seamless discharge planning
- Referrals and transfers across facilities
- Audit-ready transitions tied to roles and timestamps

It’s the heartbeat of the system—both operationally and ethically.

## 🧱 Off-Chain Architecture

To remain fast, user-friendly, and privacy-conscious, core logic lives off-chain:

- **Identity & Access Control** – role-based permissions for staff and admins
- **Patient Journey Engine** – governs valid state transitions and logs the audit trail
- **Triage, Admissions & Monitoring Modules** – structured health records, care updates, and escalation triggers
- **Referral & Discharge Workflows** – referral coordination and discharge summaries
- **Task Assignments & Notifications** – dashboard alerts and role-based responsibilities
- **Document & Form Management** – uploads, structured forms, and auto-generated reports

By centralizing this logic in a modular backend, the system remains **extensible and sovereign**—able to work offline or across diverse settings.

## 🔗 Blockchain Architecture

Rather than forcing decentralization, Health Stack OS uses blockchain where it **adds real value**:

- **Minimal Vault Contract** – accepts donor funds and allows on-chain disbursements when off-chain milestones are verified
- **Hospital Wallet Registry** – tracks verified facility addresses eligible for funding
- **Disbursement Triggers** – called by the off-chain system or designated overseers to release funds for validated achievements
- *(Optional)* **Event Anchoring** – hashed records of transitions for immutable proofs (if required)

This "thin layer" approach allows:
- Credible public transparency
- Trustless fund distribution tied to care outcomes
- Future DAO or staking integrations without architectural lock-in
