### ðŸŒ± Core Principles
- **Practicality** â€” solutions must work in real-world, resource-constrained settings  
- **Compassion** â€” every system exists to support human dignity and healing  
- **Modularity** â€” build components that evolve and scale independently  
- **Decentralization** â€” empower facilities to operate autonomously and adapt locally  

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Who Are We Serving?

We are building for the **general inpatient**:  
A patient admitted for **overnight or longer** care that **cannot be managed in an outpatient setting**. These individuals form the **core population** of a general hospital wardâ€”neither ICU-critical nor receiving specialized care like maternity, oncology, or long-term chronic disease support.

---

### ðŸ’¡ Typical Needs of General Inpatients
- **Ongoing monitoring** (e.g. vitals, IV medications, wound care)  
- **Diagnostic testing** (lab work, basic imaging)  
- **Short- to medium-term recovery** (e.g. infections, dehydration, post-op care)

### ðŸ“Œ Real-World Scenarios

- Pneumonia requiring IV antibiotics and oxygen  
- Post-surgical recovery following appendectomy  
- Diabetic foot ulcer needing wound care and glucose stabilization  
- Urinary tract infection with dehydration needing IV fluids and observation

### ðŸ§­ Why Focus on This Group?

By designing for general inpatients, we can:
- Build **universal workflows** (admission â†’ vitals â†’ medication â†’ discharge)  
- Create a **repeatable care model** for scale-up and specialization later  
- Onboard new staff into **essential clinical protocols** without requiring subspecialist training
