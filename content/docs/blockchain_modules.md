## ü™∂ Minimal Blockchain Architecture for Health Stack OS (Phase 1)

### 1. **Single Smart Contract: Staking Vault & Triggered Disbursement**
- Accepts deposits (from donors or partners)
- Ties each deposit to a hospital/clinic address
- Allows an authorized role (e.g. off-chain system or multisig) to trigger disbursements when conditions are met
- Emits events for auditability

That‚Äôs it. No DeFi integrations, no token issuance, no patient records on-chain. Just a **trust anchor** for transparent, verifiable fund movements.

---

### 2. **Off-Chain System Holds the Logic**
- All patient journey tracking, role-based access, and milestone validation happens off-chain
- Off-chain system calls the contract when a trigger condition is met (e.g. ‚ÄúHospital A discharged 100 patients with proper audits ‚Üí release X funds‚Äù)
- You could simulate this during prototyping without wiring real funds

---

### 3. **Roles**
Only two types of on-chain actors to begin with:
- **Funder (wallets sending deposits)**
- **Approver/Triggerer (your off-chain system or a DAO signer calling disbursements)**

---

### 4. **Fallback Mechanism**
If needed, include:
- **`withdraw()`** fallback for unused funds (with timeout or admin control)
- **`pause()`** capability via an admin multisig

---

### üß† Optional Audit Layer (Optional)
Anchor off-chain actions with hashed proofs (e.g., Merkle root of discharge IDs), but only if you want a basic verifiability system‚Äîpurely optional in v1.

---

## ‚ú® Why This Works
- **Minimal effort, maximum credibility**: Even a single verified disbursement proves your model works.
- **Easy to test with mock tokens or local chain**: Focus on logic, not infrastructure.
- **De-risked scope**: All patient-related complexity stays off-chain where you have full control.
