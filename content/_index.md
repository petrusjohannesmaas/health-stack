_Your digital launchpad for delivering transparent, modular care from day one_

Whether you're launching a rural clinic, mobile unit, or an experimental pilot site, **Health Stack OS** gives you the tools to go from _intake to discharge_—without legacy vendors or complex infrastructure.

---

## 🧩 What Is It?

**Health Stack OS** is a modular, off-chain-first health coordination system—designed to work in the real world before it's ever decentralized.

> _“From facility shell to care coordination, this is your zero-to-launch health stack.”_

It gives you everything you need to:
- 🧭 **Define** care workflows and state transitions (Intake → Discharge)
- 👩‍⚕️ **Assign** roles and responsibilities across clinical and admin staff
- 📋 **Track** patients through structured state machines and audit trails
- 🛠 **Build** a sustainable foundation for future blockchain integrations

---

## 🔐 A Minimal Blockchain Core

_Used only where it counts._

Health Stack OS uses a **single on-chain contract** to:
- Accept transparent donations tied to facilities
- Disburse funds based on off-chain, verified care milestones
- Emit public logs of impact

Nothing more—until you’re ready for incentives, staking, or DAO governance.

---

## 🧱 Built for Simplicity First

All core patient logic, staff roles, and transitions live **off-chain**, for speed, privacy, and modular control.

Key benefits:
- 🔧 **Local-first** design—works offline and boots instantly
- 🕒 **Faster setup** with minimal infrastructure
- 🌍 **Globally adaptable** for diverse clinic models and workflows

---

## 🌱 The Road Ahead

This is just the beginning. Health Stack OS is growing to support:
- 📊 **Incentivized funding** tied to real outcomes  
- 🧑‍⚖️ **DAO-led governance** for trust and autonomy  
- 🔄 **Interoperability with DeFi and public donors**  

We’re building not just tools—but resilient ecosystems around them.
