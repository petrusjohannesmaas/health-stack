## ðŸ§° Core Tools & Frameworks for Supply Chain Traceability

| Tool / Stack                  | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hyperledger Besu**         | Ethereum-compatible ledger with permissioning, privacy groups, IBFT     |
| **Smart Contracts (Solidity)** | Define asset lifecycle: manufacturing â†’ distribution â†’ dispensation     |
| **IPFS / Lighthouse**        | Off-chain storage for batch certificates, lab reports, or QR metadata   |
| **GS1 Standards**            | Global identifiers (GTIN, GLN) for product serialization                |
| **QR Code / NFC Integration**| Physical-to-digital linkage for medicine packaging                      |
| **Waku / libp2p**            | Secure messaging between supply chain actors (e.g. manufacturer â†” pharmacy) |
| **OpenZeppelin AccessControl** | Role-based permissions for manufacturers, regulators, pharmacists       |
| **Prometheus + Grafana**     | Monitor node health, transaction throughput, and traceability metrics   |

## ðŸ§¬ Suggested Smart Contract Modules

| Contract Name         | Functionality                                                                 |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PharmaBatch.sol`     | Register batches with metadata (origin, expiry, manufacturer ID)              |
| `SupplyChainTracker.sol` | Log events: production, shipping, receipt, dispensation                     |
| `RegulatoryAudit.sol` | Allow regulators to verify compliance and batch history                       |
| `RecallRegistry.sol`  | Flag recalled or counterfeit batches                                           |

Each event (e.g. `BatchShipped`, `BatchReceived`) can emit logs that are indexed and queried by your frontend or analytics layer.

## ðŸ”— Integration Ideas

- **QR Code on Packaging** â†’ links to IPFS CID + on-chain batch ID  
- **Pharmacist Scan** â†’ triggers `verifyBatch()` on-chain  
- **Recall Alert** â†’ pushed via Waku to all pharmacies holding affected batch  
- **Cold Chain Monitoring** â†’ IoT sensor logs signed and anchored on-chain

## ðŸ§  Bonus: Tools for Rapid Prototyping

- **Truffle or Hardhat**: For contract development and testing  
- **The Graph**: Index and query supply chain events  
- **Chainlink Functions**: Pull off-chain data (e.g. temperature logs) into smart contracts  
- **Tilkal or TraceX**: Enterprise-grade traceability platforms (can inspire your architecture)
