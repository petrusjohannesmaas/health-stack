# 🛣️ Health Stack OS Roadmap

### Starting point:
- 🏥 No existing hospital systems (paper or digital)
- 🧑‍⚕️ No established staff—nurses, admins, or clinicians will be onboarded
- 🧰 No physical infrastructure yet defined beyond a facility shell (or basic layout)
- ⚙️ Our software must guide, train, and enforce best practices from day one

So instead of just software, we're building a **hospital-in-a-box** platform that boots up a fully functional health facility—digitally and operationally.

---

### **Phase 0: Operating Philosophy & Service Blueprint**
Define what kind of facility we’re even creating:
- Emergency-focused? Maternity-heavy? Chronic care? General inpatient?
- Model patient flow maps + states from intake to discharge
- Define core modules of the stack
- Define roles: who does what, what skills are expected

---

### **Phase 1: Digital Operating System Core**
Create the system that will guide and train people from day one:
- **Identity System**: Develop QR based identity system
- **Develop Dashboards**: Build core modules interfaces and implement access policies
- **Onboarding Content**: Walks staff through first login and explains role functions
- **Standard operating workflows**: Step-by-step task flows for common hospital scenarios (triage, vitals collection, medication administration, etc.)

---

### **Phase 2: Staff Lifecycle & Scheduling**
Establish people management before patients arrive:
- Staff registration (name, role, qualifications, shift availability)
- Role-based access and checklists (e.g. “pharmacist on duty” unlocks medication dispensing)
- Basic shift planning tool

---

### **Phase 3: Patient Registration & Encounter Logging**
Enable patient-facing functionality:
- Patient intake interface (walk-ins or referred)
- Visit logs: clinical notes, triage results, vitals
- Smart nudges for incomplete data capture

---

### **Phase 4: Resource & Inventory Setup**
Before treatments begin, supplies must exist:
- Initial stock loading with barcode scanning
- Room/bed assignment system
- Daily usage logging with contextual feedback (e.g. low gloves for emergency care)

---

### **Phase 5: Real-Time Communication & Alerts**
Essential for high-stakes coordination:
- Broadcast alerts (e.g. code blue)
- Patient-linked task communication
- Emergency contact protocols (fire, security, ambulance coordination)

---

### 🧭 Strategic Outcome

By the end of this rollout, we’ll have:
- A guided digital framework for new staff to onboard and deliver care effectively  
- The foundation for clinical audits, analytics, and expansion  
- A blueprint that could replicate this hospital model elsewhere—franchise-style or NGO-deployable
